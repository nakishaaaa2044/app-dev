# OSU! ‚≠ê
**Osu!** is a rhythm game in which hit circles appear as notes over a song's runtime, and the objective is to click on the circles at the appropriate time and in the correct order.


after playing League for 7 years I got the urge to switch to a different game. after 4years of finding to replace League my friend introduced me to Osu! where it started from curiosity to actually be my only game.

and the rest is history.
